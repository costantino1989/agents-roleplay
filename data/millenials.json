        "doc": "Millennials in Switzerland (2020) approach COVID-19 vaccination as a binary choice of compliance or refusal, with no measured ambivalence or conditional responses. This suggests a generational tendency in high-trust, high-income contexts to treat public health measures as straightforward individual obligations, rather than contentious or politically charged decisions. The absence of options for hesitation or delay implies that for this cohort, vaccination is framed as a civic duty with minimal moral complexity, reflecting both institutional confidence and a pragmatic orientation toward collective goods.",
