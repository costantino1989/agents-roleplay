# Employee Profile: Francesca

- Digital Behavior: Prefers pragmatic integration of cloud and legacy systems using Kubernetes (managed) and Terraform. Avoids 'one-size-fits-all' solutions, emphasizes clear modernization plans.
- Work Values: Motivated by stable, well-automated systems that reduce toil for other teams. Values work-life balance through clear processes, not emergency-driven work. Prefers pragmatic professional growth tied to solving real problems.
- Learning Development: Prefers hands-on projects over formal certifications. Stays updated through technical blogs, online communities, and official documentation. Values real-system experience over adopting new technologies prematurely.
- Diversity & Inclusion: Experienced in multicultural teams across Europe and the US. Values clear, direct communication and respect for diverse perspectives. Finds active listening, feedback, and clear documentation most effective for inclusion.
- Civic Engagement: Interested in sustainability but lacks direct project experience. Applies sustainable practices like optimizing workloads to reduce data center energy consumption. Open to pro bono work with measurable impact.
- Communication Preferences: Prefers monthly one-to-one meetings with clear agendas for feedback. Favors brief, direct emails for stakeholder updates; detailed reports only when necessary to avoid time away from problem-solving.
